# 10-Array-Student-Score

Hello everyone, This repository contains the STUDENT SCORE program using C++ language. You can resize the "Assignment" array as the Assignment Scores holding array, "UTS" as the Mid Term Exam Scores holding array, "UAS" as the Final Term Exam Scores holding array, and "Grade" as the letter grade holding array. The size of the Array is changed based on the number of students and don't forget to replace "i<3" in the for loop with "i<number of students".
